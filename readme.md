## Synopsis

A project that goes through the Journal of Homosexuality's history on [tandfonline](http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/wjhm20) and then generates a graph of word usage, using BokehJS (TBD).
This project really isn't meant to be used for accessing Taylor & Francis's website.

## License

This project uses the MIT license so that when it does show its data, later, others can play around with it.
