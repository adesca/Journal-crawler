Using qualitative data from 526 individuals in cohabiting same-sex relationships across 47 states, we explored (1) the meaning and significance of cohabitation and (2) the perceived importance of legal marriage to the relationship. Participants viewed cohabitation as significant, most commonly because it indicates long-term commitment, provides emotional support, makes the couple a family, and allows them to share life together. Marriage was perceived as important to a majority (90%), most commonly because it confers financial and legal benefits, relational legitimacy, and demonstrates the same commitment as different-sex couples.

While these narratives attempted to discursively rescue Cochrane_s supposedly threatened masculinity, highlighting both his _ctrue_d heterosexuality and his prodigious fighting abilities, they also simultaneously celebrated the acceptance of homosexual men within the sport that Cochrane_s case implied. Thus, we suggest that these media representations of homosexuality and masculinity within MMA are indicative of declining cultural homophobia and homohysteria and an inclusive vision of masculinity, as previously described by proponents of inclusive masculinity theory.", "url": "http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00918369.2015.1008280", "title": ["_cIt Is What It Is_d: Masculinity, Homosexuality, and Inclusive Discourse in Mixed Martial Arts"]}

LB women also experience distal (e.g., discrimination) and proximal (e.g., expectations of rejection) minority stressors that are related to negative mental and physical health outcomes. The present study investigated the association between minority stressors and binge eating behaviors in LB women. A sample of 164 LB women completed an online survey that included measures of distal and proximal sexual minority stressors, emotional-focused coping, social isolation, negative affect, and binge eating. The resultant model partially supported both the psychological mediation framework and the affect regulation model. The principal finding was that among LB women, proximal stressors were associated with social isolation and emotion-focused coping, which in turn were associated with negative affect and ultimately binge eating. Overall, the study provides evidence that minority stress is associated with binge eating and may partially explain the disparity in binge eating between LB and heterosexual women.", "url": "http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00918369.2015.1008285", "title": ["Minority Stress and Binge Eating Among Lesbian and Bisexual Women"]}

However, these scales fail to address that accepting gay and lesbian people in theory is not tantamount to accepting the sexual practices engaged in by gay and lesbian people. As a result, relying on homonegativity scales and hypothetical scenarios (i.e., asking a participant to imagine a gay man or lesbian woman from personality characteristics provided) may not offer a complete view of the complexities of homonegativity. To explore this possibility, 83 men self-identifying as either largely or exclusively heterosexual rated one of three groups of images (romantic gay, erotic gay, and control) on the basis of five questions related to their emotional responses. A psychometrically sound homonegativity scale was also completed. Results indicated that homonegativity was a significant predictor of decreased happiness, anger, disgust, task enjoyment, and reported liking of the imagery. Furthermore, homonegativity was found to moderate the association between exposure to the romantic images and four of the five emotional responses (happiness, anger, disgust, and liking). Exposure to the set of erotic gay images, however, was associated with negative emotional responses, regardless of participants_ self-reported level of homonegativity (i.e., overt homonegativity possessed less moderational power for this type of imagery).

However, a marginal though insignificant increase in SES was noted in the experimental group of homosexual men.

Attempts by authority figures to protect youth through limits on their autonomy may be unintentionally leading to negative sexual health outcomes.", "url": "http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00918369.2012.694760", "title": ["Seeking Safer Sexual Spaces: Queer and Trans Young People Labeled with Intellectual Disabilities and the Paradoxical Risks of Restriction"]}

The primary purpose of this study was to investigate the correlates of health-related quality of life among African American lesbians using a cross-sectional anonymous survey with topics and measures developed by members of the African American lesbian community. Surveys were completed by 123 English speaking adult women who identified as African American lesbians and were attending the Zuna Institute's National Black Lesbian Conference. Overall, we found a very high health-related quality of life, in spite of a high frequency of health impairments. The average body mass index (BMI) for this sample was 32.2 (SD_=_.0); 13% were morbidly obese, having a BMI of 40 or more and only 15% of the women were in a healthy weight range; advancing age was associated with poorer physical functioning, decreased physical role functioning, and more pain. Health-related quality of life was associated with depression and spirituality, but not religion. This study highlights the need for subjective measures of health-related quality of life as well as checklists of diseases and disorders.", "url": "http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00918369.2012.694763", "title": ["Correlates of Wellbeing Among African American Lesbians"]}

Compared to individuals in different-sex married couples, individuals in same-sex couples were more likely to report difficulty seeing specialists, getting medical care when needed, and delays getting necessary prescription drugs. They were also more likely to report dissatisfaction with the level of respect shown by and time spent with providers. This study suggests that individuals in same-sex couples are more likely to face barriers to care and that individuals in same-sex couples have less positive perceptions of provider interactions.", "url": "http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00918369.2012.694766", "title": ["Health Care Access and Perceptions of Provider Care Among Individuals in Same-Sex Couples: Findings from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS)"]}
{"date": "2012", "test": "so this works", "articleText": "Health is an abstract term used to describe the state of the human body, a mental state or the likelihood of longevity. Throughout history, many definitions have been provided by agencies and healthcare professionals. Although the meaning of health has a long and well-examined history, there remains a gap in the literature surrounding the meaning of health to specific populations of people. The purpose of this article is to present an analysis of the meaning of health from the perspective of lesbians and bisexual women. A content analysis was performed on the definition of health as reported by 189 sexual minority women. The conclusions from this study strongly suggest that health interventions for lesbian and bisexual women focus on what women want to achieve, rather than on what individual behavior should be.", "url": "http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00918369.2012.694768", "title": ["Lesbians' and Bisexual Women's Definition of Health"]}

This study reports on data from 233 participants in The Last Drag, a seven-session, six-week group education and support intervention tailored for LGBT smokers. Data on smoking rates were collected during the first and last sessions, and at one, three, and six months post-intervention. As with many interventions over time, missing data is a challenge in determining success rates, but even using the most conservative estimates, nearly 60% were smoke-free at the end of the intervention, and 36% remained smoke-free by six months post-intervention. This success rate is comparable to, or better, than many mainstream smoking cessation interventions reported in the literature. The Last Drag is an effective, low-cost, LGBT-specific community intervention that can be replicated in other communities.", "url": "http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00918369.2012.694770", "title": ["The Last Drag: An Evaluation of an LGBT-Specific Smoking Intervention"]}

It uses a theoretical and methodological intersectional perspective to identify rhetorical strategies deployed in discursive representations salient to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, Two-Spirit, and queer American Indians and Alaska Natives. These representations reflect a context of compounded colonization, a historical configuration of co-constituting discourses based on cultural and ideological assumptions that invidiously marked a social group with consequential, continued effects. Hence, language is a vector of power and a critical vehicle in the project of decolonization.", "url": "http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00918369.2012.673901", "title": ["Intersecting Discourses on Race and Sexuality: Compounded Colonization Among LGBTTQ American Indians/Alaska Natives"]}

Fourteen Black lesbians between the ages of 16 and 24 participated in semistructured interviews. Instances of sexual prejudice and the young women's responses were thematically analyzed using open and axial qualitative coding techniques. Results indicated that participants experienced sexual prejudice frequently and even within the lesbian community. Responses to sexual prejudice included: cognitive reframing of heterosexist messages, passing, gaining support from self-created gay families, and fighting back (physically and verbally) in the event of isolated instances of sexual prejudice. Analysis focuses on how gender identity relates to experiences of sexual prejudice and identity management strategies. Findings suggest that there are parallels between the management strategies of these women and young, Black gay and bisexual males and between these women and Black women who are coping with sexism and racism.", "url": "http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00918369.2012.673940", "title": ["_cIt Ain't All as Bad as it May Seem_d: Young Black Lesbians' Responses to Sexual Prejudice"]}

The rise in popularity of mixed gay- and lesbian-friendly bars and girl circuit parties will be identified as a key area where generational tensions and discourse are being played out.
